####To run this app, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Install node on your computer if you haven't already http://nodejs.org
3. Run 'npm install' in your terminal to install the dependencies needed.
4. To find the reference of the Sphero on your computer, run 'ls /dev/tty.Sphero*' in your Terminal and copy the path returned.
5. Paste this path in the index.js file when the 'device' variable is declared.
6. Enable the bluetooth connection on your computer.
7. Wear the Myo armband and execute the unlock gesture.

You should see a message in your terminal when the Sphero is connected but it may take a few seconds. If nothing seems to happen just relaunch the app.
